# Cloud Developer Basics Code

This is a short course that is created for Humblebee staff, but may be of use to others as well.

## Progression

There is an introductory part that you should put time on before starting with the more workshop-like segments.

1. What is the Cloud?
2. Virtual machines and networking
3. Containers
4. Serverless, backends and APIs
5. Storage – Buckets and databases
6. DevOps: Commit, build and deploy your code

## Pushing code to Cloud Source Repositories

Once there is an initial connection, use `git push --all google` later in order to commit code.
