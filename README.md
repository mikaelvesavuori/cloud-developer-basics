# Cloud Developer Basics

It's no longer enough to only think of development as either frontend or backend workâ€”it's all about having a wider, more rounded competency. Right now, the public cloud is the natural spot from which to grow one's skills as it envelopes many of the ways-of-working and types of products you will want to be proficient in, when levelling up your know-how. This mini-course will take you through some of the most important concepts and services, always ending with you setting up actual micro projects.

This course is written as part of the internal skill development initiative at Humblebee, but we share it since there is a great demand for these skills. Want to work with a cloud-savvy company that naturally marries tech and design (as in UX, service, business and visual), or just plain old want to work here at Humblebee?

Before we begin, a few words about me. I'm [Mikael Vesavuori](https://mikaelvesavuori.se), a Google Cloud-certified Professional Cloud Architect who loves what the public cloud can help us achieve, regardless of job title. I've worked with clients such as the [Volvo](https://www.volvo.com/home.html) companies, [Hultafors Group](http://www.hultaforsgroup.com), and most recently [Polestar](https://www.polestar.com) who are setting up a completely new architecture from the ground up.

## Progression

This mini-course is divided into six parts:

1. What is the cloud?
2. Virtual machines and networking
3. Container
4. Serverless and APIs
5. Storage and databases
6. DevOps

Hope you are ready to learn some truly fantastic new skills!
